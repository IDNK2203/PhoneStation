## Notes

- inspect remove cart function.It works [x]

- decreasing the the quantity of objects in a cart should function until the quantity is === 1 at this point the object shoul be removed from the cart.

  - we have to check if this the quantity of an item after a decrement in quantity is = to zero and pass control to the remove item from route handler or manually remove it from the cart prodct array. [_/]

  -
- remove unnecessary field from request payloads
- create git, github and project management workflows
